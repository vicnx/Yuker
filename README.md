## Start üöÄ

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes._

### Pre requirements üìã

_What things do you need to install the software and how to install them_

You will have to install **node** and **npm**

```
apt install nodejs && apt install npm
```

You also have to have mongo and gulp installed

_There is a folder that is ignored in the repository. The credentials folder. You will have to create it with the credentials of the google and github api_

### Installation üîß

_Once all the requirements are completed, we proceed to clone the project._

_We go to the backend folder and here we will have to start the different backends that we have. We go to the first folder (for example rest) and do npm install and npm start. We repeat this process with each of the backends_

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

_Once the backends are started, we go to the Frontend folder and perform an npm install and start it with gulp_

```
npm install
```

```
gulp
```

_Now we can use the application_
